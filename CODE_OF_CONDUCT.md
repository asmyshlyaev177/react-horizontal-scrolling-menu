# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Any meaningful contribution will be appreciated.

Try to write a good code with tests(not 100% covered is ok, no need complex and fragile tests only for coverage sake).

Please try to leave code cleaner that it was before you touch it(or at least not worse). Don't make things overcomplicated.

Feel free to ask questions, report bugs or create PR. But don't create duplicates.
